class FMRefactoring(ModelToModel):
    """Interface for refactoring operations on feature models.

    A refactoring is an operation that transforms a feature model into another feature model
    without modifying its semantics (i.e., maintaining the same products).
    Refactoring normally involves restructuring the feature model (e.g., by moving features around,
    adding or removing features and/or constraints, etc.).
    Thus, configurations of the feature model may change, but the set of products remains the same.
    This means that refactorings take into account the difference between abstract and concrete 
    features.

    Note that refactorings are applied in-place, so that the given feature model is modified.
    You should create a copy of the feature model before applying the refactoring if you want to 
    keep the original model .
