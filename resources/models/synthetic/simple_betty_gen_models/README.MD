This file is containing a set of models generated by the Betty toolsuite (java version) which. We generated a set of models (consisting on 10 models) with default parameters but specifying the number of features, the percentage of cross-tree constraints. Also, we checked that all the generated models were valid. The exact number of parameters are:

* Number of features: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 15000, 20000 
* Percentage of ctc: 1, 10, 15, 30, 50

The structure of files is Number of Features / cross-tree constraints + "-" + iteration. 
Also, there is a file statistics per file specifying the characteristics of the generated model.
